In this sprint, we set up Firebase and structured most of our models and utilities, laying the groundwork for the appâ€™s database interactions. Additionally, we began developing key controllers, which will manage user and recipe data flow throughout the application. This progress brings us closer to a fully functional backend that will support essential app functionalities like user profile management, ingredient tracking, and recipe retrieval.
